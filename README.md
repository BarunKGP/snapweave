# Snapweave

Snapweave is a lightweight, web-based RAW file editor functioning similar to Lightroom.
It can apply lossless edits and export RAW files to different image formats, after applying adjustments to tone curves, HSL values, exposure, etc.

> [!WARNING]
> Snapweave is in very early stages of development and could be unstable.

Currently, only .NEF formats (Nikon) are supported.
